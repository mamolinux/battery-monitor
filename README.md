Many a times we forget to remove the laptop charger. This can reduce the battery life significantly due to overcharging. This is where Battery Monitor comes into play.

Battery Monitor is a utility tool developed on Python3 and PyGtk3. It will notify the user about charging, discharging, not charging and critically low state of the battery on Linux (surely if the battery is present). Along with showing the notification repetitively, It also plays a sound so that you don't miss the notification.

5. When battery is [critically low](#critically-low-battery-state).

Additionally, it can show notifications:
1. At three user-defined battery percentage during discharging,
2. At one user-defined battery percentage during charging,
3. Along with playing a sound (Mute option is not available yet).

### Settings Window
In Settings menu, you can configure and adjust settings for Battery Monitor. Here, you can set the battery percentage levels at which you want to get notifications. The warning levels are listed in ascending order. **Critical Battery Warning** refers to the lowest level while **First Custom Warning** refers to the highest level. Custom warning levels are optional.

**N.B.** If you change any configuration, it will be in action only after next reboot.

```$
sudo dpkg -i battery-monitor*.deb
sudo apt install -f
```

### 2. Build and Install From Source
If you are having trouble installing the pre-built binary, build them from source.

#### Debian/Ubuntu based systems
There are two methods, this app can be installed/used on a Debian/Ubuntu based system. First, download and unzip the source package using:
```
wget https://github.com/mamolinux/battery-monitor/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd battery-monitor-master
```

1. **Option 1:** Manually copying necessary files to root (`/`). For that, follow the steps below:
	1. Install python package using `pip3`:
		```
		sudo pip3 install .
		```

	2. Compile `schemas` using:
		```
		sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/local/share/glib-2.0/schemas
		```

2. **Option 2:** Build a debian package and install it. To build a debian package on your own:
	1. After using `cd battery-monitor-master`, run:
		```
		dpkg-buildpackage --no-sign
		```
		This will create a `battery-monitor_*.deb` package at `../battery-monitor-master`.
		
	2. Install the debian package using
		```
		sudo dpkg -i ../battery-monitor_*.deb
		sudo apt install -f
		```
